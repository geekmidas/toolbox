# Story 1.10: Per-App Deploy Targets

**Epic:** [Epic 1: Workspace-First Full-Stack Framework](../epic-1-workspace-first-full-stack-framework.md)

---

> As a developer,
> I want to deploy different apps to different targets,
> so that I can use the best platform for each app (e.g., Vercel for frontends).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `app.deploy` property overrides `deploy.default`
2. `deploy.default` falls back to `'dokploy'` if not specified
3. Unsupported targets (Vercel, Cloudflare) error with "coming in Phase 2" message
4. Config validated at startup, not at deploy time
5. Selective deploy respects per-app targets

## Integration Verification

- **IV1:** Apps without `deploy` override use default target
- **IV2:** Mixed-target workspace validates correctly
- **IV3:** Clear error message for Phase 2 targets

## Technical Notes

- Architecture: [Target Architecture](../../architecture/2-target-architecture.md)
- Vercel and Cloudflare support planned for Phase 2
