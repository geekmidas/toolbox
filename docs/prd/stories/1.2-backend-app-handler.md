# Story 1.2: Backend App Handler

**Epic:** [Epic 1: Workspace-First Full-Stack Framework](../epic-1-workspace-first-full-stack-framework.md)

---

> As a developer,
> I want backend apps in my workspace to work exactly like current single-app backends,
> so that I can migrate existing projects without changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Backend app handler extracts existing config properties (routes, services, envParser, logger)
2. Backend apps support all current `gkm.config.ts` options
3. Single-app configs internally represented as single-backend workspace
4. Backend app type is the default when `type` is omitted

## Integration Verification

- **IV1:** Existing backend dev server startup unchanged
- **IV2:** All current gkm.config.ts properties work in workspace backend apps
- **IV3:** No performance regression in single-backend scenarios

## Technical Notes

- Architecture: [Configuration Loading](../../architecture/3-configuration.md)
- Backwards compatibility is critical for this story
