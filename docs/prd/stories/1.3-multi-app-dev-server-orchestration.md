# Story 1.3: Multi-App Dev Server Orchestration

**Epic:** [Epic 1: Workspace-First Full-Stack Framework](../epic-1-workspace-first-full-stack-framework.md)

---

> As a developer,
> I want `gkm dev` to start all apps in my workspace concurrently,
> so that I can develop my full-stack application with one command.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `gkm dev` spawns process for each app (tsx for backends)
2. Logs aggregated with `[app-name]` prefix and color-coding
3. Graceful shutdown terminates all processes on Ctrl+C
4. `{APP_NAME}_URL` environment variables injected based on dependencies
5. Port conflicts detected and reported with clear error message
6. Dev startup completes in <5 seconds for 2-app workspace

## Integration Verification

- **IV1:** Single-app `gkm dev` unchanged in behavior and performance
- **IV2:** Backend apps receive correct URLs for their dependencies
- **IV3:** Stopping dev server cleanly terminates all child processes

## Technical Notes

- Architecture: [Dev Server](../../architecture/4-dev-server.md)
- Consider using Turbo for orchestration
