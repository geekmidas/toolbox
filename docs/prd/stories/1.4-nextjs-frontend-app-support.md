# Story 1.4: Next.js Frontend App Support

**Epic:** [Epic 1: Workspace-First Full-Stack Framework](../epic-1-workspace-first-full-stack-framework.md)

---

> As a developer,
> I want to add Next.js frontends to my workspace,
> so that I can develop full-stack applications with type-safe backends.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `type: 'frontend', framework: 'nextjs'` recognized in workspace config
2. Next.js project detected via `next.config.js` or `next.config.ts`
3. `gkm dev` spawns `next dev` for frontend apps on configured port
4. Frontend apps receive `{DEPENDENCY}_URL` for each backend dependency
5. Missing Next.js installation produces helpful error message

## Integration Verification

- **IV1:** Backend-only workspaces work without Next.js installed
- **IV2:** Frontend receives correct backend URLs during development
- **IV3:** Frontend hot reload works independently of backend changes

## Technical Notes

- Architecture: [Dev Server](../../architecture/4-dev-server.md)
- Next.js is the first and only supported frontend framework in Phase 1
