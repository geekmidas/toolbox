# Story 1.5: Smart Client Generation

**Epic:** [Epic 1: Workspace-First Full-Stack Framework](../epic-1-workspace-first-full-stack-framework.md)

---

> As a developer,
> I want typed API clients automatically generated for my frontends,
> so that I maintain type safety between backend and frontend without manual steps.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Frontend apps with `dependencies: ['api']` get client generated from `api`'s OpenAPI spec
2. Client regenerates on: new endpoint files, schema changes (.params, .query, .body, .output)
3. Client does NOT regenerate on: handler logic changes, non-endpoint file changes
4. Regeneration completes within 2 seconds
5. Generated client placed in frontend app's configured location
6. Multiple dependencies generate multiple clients (or merged client)

## Integration Verification

- **IV1:** Existing `gkm openapi` command works unchanged
- **IV2:** Manual `gkm openapi` still available as fallback
- **IV3:** File watcher doesn't trigger unnecessary regenerations

## Technical Notes

- Architecture: [Client Generation](../../architecture/7-client-generation.md)
- Smart detection of schema changes is key to avoiding churn
