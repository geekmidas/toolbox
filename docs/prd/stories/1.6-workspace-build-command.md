# Story 1.6: Workspace Build Command

**Epic:** [Epic 1: Workspace-First Full-Stack Framework](../epic-1-workspace-first-full-stack-framework.md)

---

> As a developer,
> I want `gkm build` to build all apps in dependency order,
> so that I can create production artifacts for my entire workspace.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `gkm build` builds all apps in workspace
2. Independent apps build in parallel
3. Dependent apps build after their dependencies complete
4. Backend apps use existing build logic (Lambda/server output)
5. Frontend apps use `next build` with standalone output
6. Build outputs to per-app directories

## Integration Verification

- **IV1:** Single-app `gkm build` unchanged
- **IV2:** Build fails fast if any app build fails
- **IV3:** Build artifacts are correct for each app type

## Technical Notes

- Architecture: [Integration](../../architecture/9-integration.md)
- Turbo can be leveraged for parallel builds
