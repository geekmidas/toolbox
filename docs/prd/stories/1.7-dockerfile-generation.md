# Story 1.7: Dockerfile Generation

**Epic:** [Epic 1: Workspace-First Full-Stack Framework](../epic-1-workspace-first-full-stack-framework.md)

---

> As a developer,
> I want to generate optimized Dockerfiles for my apps,
> so that I can deploy to container-based platforms like Dokploy.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `gkm docker` generates Dockerfile for each app
2. Backend Dockerfiles optimized for Node.js (multi-stage, minimal image)
3. Frontend Dockerfiles optimized for Next.js standalone
4. Dockerfiles generated on-demand, not committed
5. Monorepo-aware: copies only relevant packages
6. Supports custom base image configuration

## Integration Verification

- **IV1:** Generated Dockerfiles build successfully
- **IV2:** Built images run correctly in isolation
- **IV3:** No secrets or sensitive data in Dockerfiles

## Technical Notes

- Architecture: [Docker](../../architecture/5-docker.md)
- Uses Turbo prune for monorepo optimization
