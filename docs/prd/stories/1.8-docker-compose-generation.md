# Story 1.8: Docker Compose Generation

**Epic:** [Epic 1: Workspace-First Full-Stack Framework](../epic-1-workspace-first-full-stack-framework.md)

---

> As a developer,
> I want to generate docker-compose.yml for local containerized development,
> so that I can test my deployment setup locally before deploying to Dokploy.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `gkm compose` generates `docker-compose.yml` for workspace
2. Each app defined as a service
3. Service discovery: apps can reach each other by name
4. Ports mapped according to workspace config
5. Environment variables injected with `{APP_NAME}_URL` pattern
6. Compatible with Docker Compose v2

## Integration Verification

- **IV1:** `docker compose up` starts all services
- **IV2:** Apps can communicate via service names
- **IV3:** Compose file matches Dokploy deployment structure

## Technical Notes

- Architecture: [Docker](../../architecture/5-docker.md)
- Services include infrastructure (db, cache, mail)
