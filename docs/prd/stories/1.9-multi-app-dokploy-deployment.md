# Story 1.9: Multi-App Dokploy Deployment

**Epic:** [Epic 1: Workspace-First Full-Stack Framework](../epic-1-workspace-first-full-stack-framework.md)

---

> As a developer,
> I want `gkm deploy` to deploy my entire workspace to Dokploy,
> so that I can ship my full-stack application with one command.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `gkm deploy` deploys all apps to Dokploy
2. Workspace maps to one Dokploy project
3. Each app maps to one Dokploy application
4. Deployment respects dependency order (backends before dependent frontends)
5. Environment variables synced per-app including `{APP_NAME}_URL`
6. `gkm deploy [app...]` supports selective deployment

## Integration Verification

- **IV1:** Existing single-app Dokploy deploy unchanged
- **IV2:** Selective deploy only affects specified apps
- **IV3:** Deployment URLs correctly resolved for inter-app communication

## Technical Notes

- Architecture: [Integration](../../architecture/9-integration.md)
- Builds on existing Dokploy integration in `deploy/dokploy.ts`
