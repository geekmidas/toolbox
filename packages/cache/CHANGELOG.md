## 1.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 🐛 [#11](https://github.com/geekmidas/toolbox/pull/11) [`40f4dc0`](https://github.com/geekmidas/toolbox/commit/40f4dc095911b2223a255029d8f776caf7781309) Thanks [@geekmidas](https://github.com/geekmidas)! - Patch release across all packages to realign published versions with the
  registry. The previous release only published the four packages that had
  version bumps; the remaining packages failed with "cannot publish over the
  previously published versions" because their versions were unchanged.

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 🐛 [`d70c6c0`](https://github.com/geekmidas/toolbox/commit/d70c6c0aeb8a79da2473ac77dbd8255a4a2f5651) Thanks [@geekmidas](https://github.com/geekmidas)! - Fix `package.json` exports so TypeScript declarations resolve correctly under NodeNext/Bundler module resolution. Each subpath export now nests `types` inside its `import`/`require` condition, pointing at the `.d.mts` and `.d.cts` files that `tsdown` actually emits (previously the exports referenced non-existent `.d.ts` files, causing type-resolution failures for consumers). Both ESM (`.mjs`) and CJS (`.cjs`) runtime entry points are preserved. Additionally, `@geekmidas/ui` had `import` paths pointing at `.js` files that were never emitted — those are corrected to `.mjs`.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- ✨ [`be4f7a9`](https://github.com/geekmidas/toolbox/commit/be4f7a9bd5de7f08adbca582916d6902e0c24de2) Thanks [@geekmidas](https://github.com/geekmidas)! - Add partition support for manifest generation. Users can now group constructs (routes, functions, crons, subscribers) into named partitions by providing a `partition` callback per construct type in the config. Manifests output partitioned fields as `Record<string, T[]>` while remaining flat `T[]` arrays when no partitions are configured.

  Fix mutation type inference in endpoint hooks by using `UseMutationResult` and `UseQueryResult` types directly instead of `ReturnType<typeof useMutation>`, which could resolve to `never` for complex path definitions.

  Add `FileCache` implementation that persists cache entries to a JSON file on disk. Default location is `process.cwd()/.gkm/cache.json`. Uses an in-process mutex combined with `proper-lockfile` for safe concurrent and cross-process writes.
