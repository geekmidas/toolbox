## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 🐛 [#11](https://github.com/geekmidas/toolbox/pull/11) [`40f4dc0`](https://github.com/geekmidas/toolbox/commit/40f4dc095911b2223a255029d8f776caf7781309) Thanks [@geekmidas](https://github.com/geekmidas)! - Patch release across all packages to realign published versions with the
  registry. The previous release only published the four packages that had
  version bumps; the remaining packages failed with "cannot publish over the
  previously published versions" because their versions were unchanged.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 🐛 [`d70c6c0`](https://github.com/geekmidas/toolbox/commit/d70c6c0aeb8a79da2473ac77dbd8255a4a2f5651) Thanks [@geekmidas](https://github.com/geekmidas)! - Fix `package.json` exports so TypeScript declarations resolve correctly under NodeNext/Bundler module resolution. Each subpath export now nests `types` inside its `import`/`require` condition, pointing at the `.d.mts` and `.d.cts` files that `tsdown` actually emits (previously the exports referenced non-existent `.d.ts` files, causing type-resolution failures for consumers). Both ESM (`.mjs`) and CJS (`.cjs`) runtime entry points are preserved. Additionally, `@geekmidas/ui` had `import` paths pointing at `.js` files that were never emitted — those are corrected to `.mjs`.
