## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 🐛 [`d70c6c0`](https://github.com/geekmidas/toolbox/commit/d70c6c0aeb8a79da2473ac77dbd8255a4a2f5651) Thanks [@geekmidas](https://github.com/geekmidas)! - Fix `package.json` exports so TypeScript declarations resolve correctly under NodeNext/Bundler module resolution. Each subpath export now nests `types` inside its `import`/`require` condition, pointing at the `.d.mts` and `.d.cts` files that `tsdown` actually emits (previously the exports referenced non-existent `.d.ts` files, causing type-resolution failures for consumers). Both ESM (`.mjs`) and CJS (`.cjs`) runtime entry points are preserved. Additionally, `@geekmidas/ui` had `import` paths pointing at `.js` files that were never emitted — those are corrected to `.mjs`.
