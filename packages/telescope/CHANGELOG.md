# @geekmidas/telescope

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#9](https://github.com/geekmidas/toolbox/pull/9) [`e31a60a`](https://github.com/geekmidas/toolbox/commit/e31a60a971366180a0e7bec6e7da56d8f36aa21f) Thanks [@geekmidas](https://github.com/geekmidas)! - Support kysely 0.29.

  kysely 0.29 moved `Migrator` and `FileMigrationProvider` from the root barrel
  (`'kysely'`) to the `'kysely/migration'` subpath. `@geekmidas/testkit`'s
  `PostgresKyselyMigrator` now imports `Migrator` from `'kysely/migration'` and
  its kysely peer becomes `~0.29.4` — consumers must be on kysely 0.29+.

  The library packages that only declare a kysely _peer_ (`db`, `audit`, `studio`,
  `telescope`) don't touch the moved symbols, so their peer range is _widened_ to
  `>=0.28.2 <0.30.0` — they now support both 0.28 and 0.29 (non-breaking).

  `@geekmidas/cli`'s scaffolded `test/globalSetup.ts` template now imports
  `FileMigrationProvider` from `'kysely/migration'` so generated projects work on
  kysely 0.29.

### Patch Changes

- 🐛 [`d70c6c0`](https://github.com/geekmidas/toolbox/commit/d70c6c0aeb8a79da2473ac77dbd8255a4a2f5651) Thanks [@geekmidas](https://github.com/geekmidas)! - Fix `package.json` exports so TypeScript declarations resolve correctly under NodeNext/Bundler module resolution. Each subpath export now nests `types` inside its `import`/`require` condition, pointing at the `.d.mts` and `.d.cts` files that `tsdown` actually emits (previously the exports referenced non-existent `.d.ts` files, causing type-resolution failures for consumers). Both ESM (`.mjs`) and CJS (`.cjs`) runtime entry points are preserved. Additionally, `@geekmidas/ui` had `import` paths pointing at `.js` files that were never emitted — those are corrected to `.mjs`.
